                                History has been proof of the thousands of war which have taken place in all periods at
                                different levels between nations. Thus, we learned that peace played an important role
                                in ending these wars or even preventing some of them. In fact, if you take a look at all
                                religious <dfn
                                    title="books of religious importance for particular religions">scriptures</dfn> and
                                ceremonies, you will realize that all of them teach peace. They
                                mostly <dfn title="to support a particular plan or action">advocate</dfn> eliminating
                                war and maintaining harmony. In other words, all of them hold
                                out a sacred <dfn title="an agreement to do something">commitment</dfn> to peace. It is
                                after the thousands of destructive wars that humans
                                realized the importance of peace. Earth needs peace in order to survive. This applies to
                                every angle including wars, pollution, natural disasters and more. When peace and
                                harmony
                                are maintained, things will continue to run smoothly without any delay. Moreover, it can
                                be
                                a saviour for many who do not wish to engage in any <dfn
                                    title="destructing">disrupting</dfn> activities or more. In other
                                words, while war destroys and disrupts, peace builds and strengthens as well as
                                restores.
                                Moreover, peace is personal which helps us achieve security and <dfn
                                    title="peace">tranquillity</dfn> and avoid
                                anxiety and chaos to make our lives better.

                                There are many ways in which we can maintain peace at different levels. To begin with
                                humankind, it is essential to maintain equality, security and justice to maintain the
                                <dfn
                                    title="the governing arrangements among a group of states, including its fundamental rules, principles and institutions.">political
                                    order</dfn> of any nation. Further, we must promote the advancement of technology
                                and science which will ultimately benefit all of humankind and maintain the welfare of
                                people. In addition, introducing a global economic system will help eliminate <dfn
                                    title="a difference in opinions, interests, etc">divergence</dfn>,
                                mistrust and regional imbalance.It is also essential to encourage ethics that promote
                                ecological prosperity and incorporate solutions to resolve the environmental crisis.
                                This
                                will in turn share success and fulfil the responsibility of individuals to end
                                historical
                                <dfn title="an unreasonable or unfair opinion">prejudices</dfn>. Similarly, we must also
                                adopt a mental and spiritual ideology that embodies
                                a helpful attitude to spread harmony. We must also recognize diversity and integration
                                for expressing emotion to enhance our friendship with everyone from different cultures.
                                Finally, it must be everyone’s noble mission to promote peace by expressing its
                                contribution
                                to the long-lasting well-being factor of everyone’s lives. Thus, we must all try our
                                level
                                best to maintain peace and harmony.
